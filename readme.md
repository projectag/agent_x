I speak no truth, yet my words can start a war. I wear no uniform, but my presence opens every door. My greatest skill is disappearing, leaving not a trace, Or appearing right beside you, with a familiar face.

I gather whispers, but spread only what serves my aim, Playing a silent game where no one knows my name. My currency is trust, freely given, then betrayed, A secret kept, a promise made, then meticulously unmade.
