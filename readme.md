I dwell in the gray spaces, where light and darkness meet. My office has no walls; my address is the street. I am a student of history, knowing every nation's fear, But the only books I read are the codes that disappear.

My name changes with the visa, my profession with the tide, My true self is a weakness I must constantly hide. I am a master of small talk, drawing truth from careless lips, A careful listener to silence, gathering digital clips.

I carry nothing I can't lose, and trust no one I meet. I sow confusion in the powerful and guide the silent feet. A whispered phrase is my weapon, a misplaced file my shield. The moment I succeed is the moment I must yield My presence, melt away, and leave the landscape cleared.

I am a loyal ghost, loved by no one, but greatly feared.
