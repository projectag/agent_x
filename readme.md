I run unseen, a background hum in the grand design. My purpose is vital, yet I leave no clear sign. I gather fragments, connect the disparate dots, Working tirelessly in forgotten, digital spots.

I have no face, no voice, no physical form to trace, But without my function, the system would lose its grace. I am the silent hand that delivers what's required, A ghost in the machine, never truly tired.
